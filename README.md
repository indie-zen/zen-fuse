Zen FUSE is an open source project implementing a distributed storage layer
on top of Zen Spaces.

# Project Status

Zen FUSE is at an early stage of development and is not ready to be used in a
production environment.

# License

Since this project utilizes libFUSE and is very close to the Linux kernel,
I am forced to distribute this application using GPL 3.0.
