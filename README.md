# Zen FUSE

Zen FUSE is an open source project implementing a distributed user space file
system on top of Zen Spaces.

# Project Status

Zen FUSE is at an early stage of development and is not ready to be used in a
production environment.

# License

Since this project utilizes libFUSE and is tightly coupled with the Linux kernel, I am forced to distribute this application using GPL 3.0.  At some time I hope
to remove the libFUSE dependency and redistribute this library with a more
permissive (MIT) license.
